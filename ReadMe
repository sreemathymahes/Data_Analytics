We will be addressing a binary classification problem, where each sample can only belong to one of two classes. This is an example of information based learning. Specifically, we will utilize various clinical parameters about a patient to determine whether or not they are likely to have heart disease.In other words, the task at hand is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their clinical characteristics.
